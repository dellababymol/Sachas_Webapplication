     <h1> Sacha’s Sweet Tale</h1>
One day in 1976, to fulfil the birthday wish of her little nephew, the founder decided to bake a black
forest cake in the shape of a car, a wish as innocent and full of fun as her little nephew. She worked such
wonders that soon, not only her nephew, but her friends and relatives boasted about Sacha’s custom
cake, wanting more, spreading her name, making requests and placing orders.

Thus, leading to Sacha’s journey. Taking her business from her home to a shop, Sacha's created signature
Black Forest Cakes, customized according to her client’s wishes and within a few years, Sacha’s became the go to place for all of Karachi.

Thirty Years later, Sacha’s Cakes is still engraved in the memories of those that recall the excitement of cutting a custom-made black forest cake for all occasions.

With a new vision, some of the old Sacha's Clients of the iconic bakery re-launched Sacha’s by adapting to
today’s customer needs, attracting to those children who now is a parent and wishes to continue the
tradition of what they grew up with. This could only happen by engaging the same artesian bakers of the
original era and adopting social and digital media as mode of communication, providing the value which
todays customers seek. Over 300000 Facebook likes and over 10000 customized cakes delivered. Sacha's
Cakes today is the first bakery chain which delivers its cake to its customer’s right up to midnight. Customization is the key for Sacha’s Cakes continuous success.

Today Sacha has 7 Branches as well as serving International Customers who want to send cakes and bouquets to their loved ones in Karachi through its website www.sachascakes.com and accepts payments through credit/debit card payment.

Sacha’s Cakes is an outstanding example of adopting old values with current trends of customer’s needs.
